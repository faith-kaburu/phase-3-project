# Student Record Management CLI Application

## Problem Statement

Managing student records in educational institutions can be a daunting task. There's a need for a simple and efficient tool to help schools, colleges, or educators organize and access student information easily.

## Solution

To address this problem, we propose the development of a Student Record Management CLI application. This application will empower educational institutions to maintain, update, and retrieve student records seamlessly, ensuring efficient management of student information.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### Student Management:

- Add new student records with details like name, age, and grade.
- List all student records.
- View details of a specific student by name or student ID.
- Update student record details.
- Delete student records.

### Course Management:

- Add new courses with details like course name.
- List all available courses.
- View details of a specific course.
- Update course information.
- Delete courses.

### Enrollment Management:

- Enroll students in courses and assign grades.
- View enrollments for individual students or courses.
- Update enrollment details (e.g., grades).

### Command Line Interface (CLI):

- Create an intuitive command-line interface (CLI) with commands for student management, course management, and enrollment management.

### Virtual Environment:

- Set up a virtual environment using Pipenv to efficiently manage project dependencies.

## Technologies Used

- Python (for backend)
- SQLAlchemy (for database operations)
- SQLite (as the database for simplicity)
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- alembic

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment using Pipenv.
   ```shell
   pipenv install
3. Activate the virtual environment
    `pipenv shell`
4. run the application using 
   `python3 main.py`
